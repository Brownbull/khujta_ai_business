## COMMON EARLY MISTAKES TO AVOID

### Don't:
- ❌ **Offer too much for free:** Your time has value
- ❌ **Discount too heavily:** Devalues your service
- ❌ **Take clients you know you can't help:** Hurts reputation
- ❌ **Promise specific results:** You can't guarantee business outcomes
- ❌ **Ignore small businesses:** They might be your best advocates
- ❌ **Get discouraged after rejections:** It's a numbers game
- ❌ **Forget to follow up:** Most sales happen in follow-up
- ❌ **Neglect existing clients for new ones:** Retention > acquisition

### Do:
- ✅ **Charge your worth:** You have 10 years of expertise
- ✅ **Be selective:** Better to have 3 great clients than 10 mediocre ones
- ✅ **Over-deliver on first clients:** They're your case studies
- ✅ **Ask for feedback:** "¿Cómo puedo hacer esto más útil?"
- ✅ **Request referrals:** "¿Conoces otro negocio que podría beneficiarse?"
- ✅ **Document everything:** Every insight, every meeting, every win
- ✅ **Be patient:** Building trust takes time in small communities
- ✅ **Stay learning:** Each client teaches you something
