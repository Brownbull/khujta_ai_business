## Tips for Success

**Listen More Than You Talk**
- Target: 60% them talking, 40% you
- Take genuine interest in their challenges
- Don't interrupt their stories
- Ask follow-up questions

**Be Consultative, Not Salesy**
- Lead with questions, not pitches
- If you genuinely can't help them, say so
- Build trust over making the sale
- Villarrica is small - reputation matters

**Show, Don't Tell**
- Concrete examples > abstract benefits
- Walk through actual report > describing what reports look like
- Specific numbers > "we help you grow"

**Handle Objections With Empathy**
- "Entiendo completamente..." before addressing
- Never argue or get defensive
- Acknowledge valid concerns
- Provide evidence, not assurances

**Always Be Closing (Softly)**
- Every meeting should end with next step
- Even if it's "let's talk again in 3 months"
- Never leave without a clear follow-up plan

**Build Local Credibility**
- Mention you're from Villarrica / local connection
- Reference local business challenges you understand
- Show commitment to local economy
- Ask for referrals to other local businesses

**Remember: You're not just selling a service - you're building GabeDA's reputation in Villarrica one meeting at a time. Quality over quantity. Deep relationships over quick sales.**
