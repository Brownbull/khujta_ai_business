# Feature Engine Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a **dynamic, self-documenting feature store** for the business analytics engine. This system transforms hardcoded calculation methods into a flexible, discoverable architecture with automatic dependency resolution.

## What Was Built

### Core Components

1. **`feature_engine/metadata.py`** - Feature metadata and data types
   - `FeatureMetadata` class with comprehensive metadata
   - `FeatureCategory` enum (filter, attribute, score, preprocessing)
   - `DataType` enum for type safety

2. **`feature_engine/decorators.py`** - Declarative feature definition
   - `@feature` decorator for easy registration
   - Convenience decorators: `@filter_feature`, `@attribute_feature`, `@score_feature`
   - Automatic metadata attachment and registration

3. **`feature_engine/registry.py`** - Central feature registry
   - Feature storage and indexing (by category, tag)
   - Dependency graph management
   - Topological sort for execution ordering
   - Search and introspection capabilities

4. **`feature_engine/executor.py`** - Feature execution engine
   - Automatic dependency resolution
   - Input validation before execution
   - Execution tracking and logging
   - Support for filters, attributes, and scores

5. **`feature_engine/introspection.py`** - Runtime inspection tools
   - Feature catalog generation (dict, JSON, Markdown, text)
   - Dependency tree visualization
   - Registry statistics and validation

6. **`feature_engine/README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation
   - Quick start guide
   - API reference
   - Migration examples
   - Best practices

### Examples and Tests

7. **`feature_engine/example_migration.py`** - Migration demonstration
   - Shows old pattern vs new pattern
   - Complete working examples
   - Benefits comparison

8. **`test_feature_engine_simple.py`** - Test suite
   - Tests all core functionality
   - Validates registry, dependencies, execution
   - **All tests passing ✓**

## Key Features

### ✅ Self-Documenting
Each feature declares:
- Required inputs (`requires`)
- Dependencies (`depends_on`)
- Output type (`dtype`)
- Description and metadata

### ✅ Automatic Dependency Resolution
- Features declare dependencies
- Executor automatically determines execution order
- Topological sort handles complex dependency chains
- Circular dependency detection

### ✅ Runtime Introspection
```python
# Get feature info
info = registry.introspect('profit_margin')

# Search features
results = registry.search('profit')

# Get dependency tree
tree = get_dependency_tree(registry, 'my_feature')
```

### ✅ Input Validation
- Validates required config keys before execution
- Checks column availability
- Verifies dependencies exist
- Dry-run mode for execution planning

### ✅ Easy Extension
```python
@feature(
    name='my_feature',
    description='What it does',
    category='filter',
    dtype='float',
    requires=['revenue_col'],
    depends_on=['other_feature']
)
def calculate_my_feature(df, config):
    # Your logic here
    return df
```

## Usage Examples

### Define a Feature

```python
from feature_engine import feature

@feature(
    name='profit_margin',
    description='Profit margin percentage',
    category='filter',
    dtype='float',
    requires=['revenue_col', 'cost_col']
)
def calculate_profit_margin(df, config):
    revenue_col = config['revenue_col']
    cost_col = config['cost_col']

    df['profit_margin'] = ((df[revenue_col] - df[cost_col]) / df[revenue_col]) * 100
    return df
```

### Execute with Dependencies

```python
from feature_engine import executor

# Automatically resolves and executes dependencies
result = executor.execute_with_dependencies(
    df,
    'my_feature',  # Will execute all dependencies first
    config,
    verbose=True
)
```

### Introspect Features

```python
from feature_engine import registry

# List all features
print(f"Total features: {len(registry)}")
print(f"Filters: {registry.count('filter')}")

# Get feature details
info = registry.introspect('profit_margin')
print(f"Requires: {info['requires']}")
print(f"Dependencies: {info['depends_on']}")
```

## Migration Path

### Old Pattern (Hardcoded)
```python
class FilterEngine:
    def _filter_profit_margin(self, df):
        df['profit_margin'] = ...
        return df

    # Problems:
    # ❌ No way to discover requirements
    # ❌ Manual dependency management
    # ❌ Hard to test in isolation
```

### New Pattern (Dynamic)
```python
@feature(
    name='profit_margin',
    category='filter',
    dtype='float',
    requires=['revenue_col', 'cost_col']
)
def calculate_profit_margin(df, config):
    df['profit_margin'] = ...
    return df

# Benefits:
# ✅ Self-documenting
# ✅ Auto dependency resolution
# ✅ Runtime introspection
# ✅ Easy to test
```

## Test Results

**All tests passing!** ✓

```
Test 1: Registry Operations         [PASS]
Test 2: Introspection               [PASS]
Test 3: Dependency Resolution       [PASS]
Test 4: Execution Order             [PASS]
Test 5: Input Validation            [PASS]
Test 6: Feature Execution           [PASS]
Test 7: Execution with Dependencies [PASS]
```

## Architecture Benefits

### For Developers
- **Discoverability**: See all available features with `registry.get_all()`
- **Type Safety**: Metadata includes data types and expectations
- **Testing**: Test features in isolation without full pipeline
- **Documentation**: Features self-document their requirements

### For the System
- **Extensibility**: Add features by decorating functions
- **Maintainability**: Clear dependencies and requirements
- **Reliability**: Validation before execution catches errors early
- **Performance**: Execute only required features

### For Integration
- **Backward Compatible**: Can coexist with existing code
- **Incremental Migration**: Migrate features one at a time
- **Flexible**: Works with existing config system
- **Composable**: Features can build on each other

## Next Steps

### Immediate Use
1. Start migrating existing filters from `waterfall/scripts/filters.py`
2. Add `@feature` decorators with metadata
3. Test migrated features individually
4. Update `main_driver.py` to use executor

### Phase 1: Migrate Filters
- Convert all filter methods to decorated functions
- Add comprehensive metadata
- Test backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Migrate Attributes
- Convert aggregation methods
- Handle complex dependencies
- Test with real data

### Phase 3: Migrate Scores
- Convert scoring logic
- Integrate with existing alert system
- Validate end-to-end

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Generate feature catalog
- Create migration guides
- Update CLAUDE.md

**Total Lines of Code**: ~1,700 lines
**Documentation**: ~500 lines
**Tests**: All passing

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Decorator Pattern**: Makes feature definition clean and natural
2. **Singleton Registry**: Global registry for easy access across modules
3. **Topological Sort**: Automatic execution ordering via Kahn's algorithm
4. **Metadata-First**: All information captured in metadata for introspection
5. **Type Safety**: Enums for categories and data types prevent errors

## Inspiration

Based on:
- **Reference project** (`/reference`): Feature lists with metadata
- **Current waterfall** (`/waterfall`): Pipeline architecture
- **Feature stores**: Industry best practices (Feast, Tecton)

## Conclusion

The Feature Engine provides a **production-ready, extensible foundation** for dynamic feature management in the business analytics engine. It combines the declarative simplicity of modern ML feature stores with the practical needs of business analytics pipelines.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed static, hardcoded methods into a dynamic, self-documenting system with automatic dependency resolution and runtime introspection.
