## Implementation Guide

### Notebook Configuration
```python
# Single configuration cell at the top
from business_analytics import *

# Set analysis parameters
config = {
    'analysis_date': 'current',  # or specific date
    'top_products_threshold': 0.2,  # Top 20%
    'dead_stock_days': 30,
    'currency_format': 'CLP',
    'language': 'EN'  # or 'ES'
}

# Initialize analyzer with data source
analyzer = BusinessAnalyzer(
    data_source='path/to/data',
    config=config
)
```

### Function Calls Structure
Each section would have simple, clean function calls:

```python
# Executive Dashboard
analyzer.show_executive_dashboard()

# Revenue Analysis
analyzer.show_revenue_concentration()
analyzer.get_pareto_insights()

# Inventory Health
analyzer.show_inventory_health()
analyzer.get_liquidation_priorities()

# Operational Insights
analyzer.show_revenue_heatmap()
analyzer.get_staffing_recommendations()

# Strategic Recommendations
analyzer.generate_recommendations()
```

### Design Principles
1. **One insight per cell** - Each cell produces one clear visualization or insight
2. **No code complexity** - All logic hidden in imported functions
3. **Interactive elements** - Dropdown filters for date ranges, categories
4. **Auto-refresh capability** - Can be scheduled to run automatically
5. **Export-ready** - Each section can be exported as PDF/PowerPoint
6. **Mobile-responsive** - Visualizations adapt to different screen sizes

### Value Delivery Focus
- **Time to Insight**: < 30 seconds to see critical metrics
- **Decision Support**: Each section answers specific business questions
- **Action Orientation**: Every analysis leads to clear next steps
- **ROI Visibility**: Quantify impact of recommended actions
